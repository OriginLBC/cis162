<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a motivated student excited to learn HTML. I have previous experience coding with python in a prior class at Cerritos College. I also have some knowledge with cmd prompt  with some I.T courses I have taken so I'm sort of familiar learning another language and abstract problems and solutions. My journey into learning more about technology excites me. I am excited to step foward in learning HTML and see how far my education can take me in the future.</p>
